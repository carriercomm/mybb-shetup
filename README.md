# mybb-shetup

Bash script that downloads, extracts and prepares MyBB to be installed. Please note this does not actually install MyBB, you still need to run the install script. But for those who are constantly installing new copies of MyBB this saves a lot of time.

The name is a play on the word shell and setup. I am not proud of this.

## Running mybb-shetup

To use mybb-shetup open up a terminal and run:

```
$ ./mybb-shetup.sh
```

Alternatively you can also run:

```
$ sh mybb-shetup.sh
